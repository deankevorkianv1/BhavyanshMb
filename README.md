This is a Github Pages website that hosts the achievements of Bhavyansh Mishra over four years of his Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering at University of West Florida

## Projects

### [Medium](https://github.com/BhavyanshM/Medium/)

MP3 player with animations to select sound tracks and play them. Users can add their own sound tracks and listen to them. Uses Object-Oriented approach behind the scenes using JavaFX to generate the Graphical User Interface.

### [Unmanned System Algorithms](https://github.com/BhavyanshM/)

Obstacle Avoidance and Path-planning algorithms implemented for the UWF Team (Air Argos) for the AUVSI-SUAS 2018 Competition using JavaFX. The project contains a simulator built using Java. This tool simulates both moving and static obstacles as well as finds feasible paths around them in real-time. It then injects the real-time waypoint information into the Ground Control Station used to command the UAV. 

### [Microservices Builder Tool](https://github.com/BhavyanshM/Microservice-Builder/)

A tool to generate Microservices Architecture Infrastructure-as-Code files using a Graphical tool built using JavaFX and JFoenix. It allows the user to generate Dockerfiles, Docker-Compose configuration file, NGINX Reverse Proxy configuration file, and scripts for automatic setup of MongoDB database containers, all with a few simple clicks.
